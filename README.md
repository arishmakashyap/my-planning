# My productivity diary

Me, Arishma Kashyap has vowed to keep this diary where I will record all my important activities to keep myself in check as I tend to 
build a great future for myself.

## My first aim:

For this year first I wish to get into a medical college which has always been my dream and my life. (In the meantime I moan too much about AEC! :P).

So, till May 6th I wish to prepare for Medicals (**NEET**).
My routine consists of rowwise schedule according to time.
